This repository is created as part of my Udacity learning. It is the quiz app challenges or tasks that I need to perform. Udacity provides most of the code to start with. I do not fork from the original repository because Udacity groups all the small projects to 1 repository, while I want to break it down per project. Original Github source code : https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-uikit
